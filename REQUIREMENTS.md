# Web Vulnerability Scanner Requirements

## Project Overview
A C# application designed to scan websites for various injection vulnerabilities, including but not limited to SQL injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), XML injection, JSON injection, and image-based injections.

## Introduction

This document outlines the security requirements for the SentinelVulnScan project, a C# application designed to scan websites for various injection vulnerabilities. It is designed to be used by security professionals and developers to identify security weaknesses in web applications before they can be exploited by malicious actors.

## Functional Requirements

- **1.1** The system shall scan for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **1.2** The system shall scan for XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities.
- **1.3** The system shall scan for XML injection vulnerabilities.
- **1.4** The system shall scan for JSON injection vulnerabilities.
- **1.5** The system shall scan for LDAP injection vulnerabilities.
- **1.6** The system shall scan for command injection vulnerabilities.
- **1.7** The system shall detect injection points in image metadata and uploads.

### 2. User Interface
- **2.1** The system shall provide a GUI interface for configuration and reporting.
- **2.2** The system shall also provide a command-line interface for automation.
- **2.3** The system shall display scan progress in real-time.

### 3. Scan Configuration
- **3.1** The system shall allow users to specify target URLs.
- **3.2** The system shall allow users to configure scanning depth.
- **3.3** The system shall support authentication to scan protected resources.
- **3.4** The system shall allow users to select specific vulnerability types to scan for.
- **3.5** The system shall support rate limiting to prevent overloading target websites.

### 4. Reporting
- **4.1** The system shall generate detailed reports of discovered vulnerabilities.
- **4.2** The system shall categorize vulnerabilities by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
- **4.3** The system shall provide remediation suggestions for each vulnerability type.
- **4.4** The system shall support report export in multiple formats (PDF, HTML, XML, JSON).

### 5. Payload Management
- **5.1** The system shall maintain a database of injection payloads for each vulnerability type.
- **5.2** The system shall allow users to add custom payloads.
- **5.3** The system shall intelligently modify payloads based on target response patterns.

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Architecture
- **1.1** The system shall be developed in C# using .NET 6.0 or later.
- **1.2** The system shall follow a modular design to allow easy extension for new vulnerability types.

### 2. Performance
- **2.1** The system shall support multi-threading for concurrent scanning.
- **2.2** The system shall efficiently manage system resources during scans.
- **2.3** The system shall be capable of scanning medium-sized websites (up to 1000 pages) in under 2 hours.

### 3. Security
- **3.1** The system shall securely handle credentials for authenticated scans.
- **3.2** The system shall clearly indicate the potential impact of each test before execution.
- **3.3** The system shall include an option for non-intrusive scanning.

### 4. Integration
- **4.1** The system shall provide an API for integration with other security tools.
- **4.2** The system shall support integration with CI/CD pipelines.
- **4.3** The system shall allow export of results to common vulnerability management platforms.

## Constraints and Limitations
- The scanner shall only be used on websites where proper authorization has been obtained.
- The scanner shall include mechanisms to prevent application denial of service.
- The scanner shall clearly identify itself in HTTP requests via user-agent strings.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with vulnerability databases like CVE and CWE
- Machine learning capabilities to reduce false positives
- Support for scanning REST API endpoints
- Enhanced detection of DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities
- Support for scanning GraphQL endpoints for injection vulnerabilities

## Vulnerability Types

### 1. SQL Injection
SQL Injection (SQLi) is a code injection technique that might destroy your database. It is one of the most common web hacking techniques and occurs when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query.

#### Detection Capabilities
- Error-based SQL injection detection
- Boolean-based blind SQL injection detection
- Time-based blind SQL injection detection
- UNION query-based SQL injection detection

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection where malicious scripts are injected into otherwise trusted websites, allowing attackers to execute scripts in victims' browsers.

#### Detection Capabilities
- Reflected XSS detection
- Stored XSS detection
- DOM-based XSS detection
- Context-aware XSS payload generation and testing

### 3. XML Injection
XML Injection, including XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, exploit vulnerable XML processors and parsers, allowing attackers to access protected files or execute remote code.

#### Detection Capabilities
- XXE detection
- XML bomb detection
- XPath injection detection
- SOAP injection testing

### 4. JSON Injection
JSON Injection occurs when untrusted data is inserted into JSON context, potentially leading to data structure manipulation or application logic bypassing.

#### Detection Capabilities
- NoSQL injection detection for document databases
- JavaScript prototype pollution testing
- JSON schema validation bypass testing
- JSON parser vulnerability testing

### 5. Command Injection
Command Injection is an attack in which the goal is to execute arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application.

#### Detection Capabilities
- OS command injection detection
- Blind command injection detection using time delays
- Output-based command injection detection
- Environment variable manipulation detection

## Implementation Details

### Scanner Implementation

#### Payload Generation
- System shall maintain a comprehensive database of attack payloads for each vulnerability type
- System shall support context-aware payload generation
- System shall allow custom payload addition
- System shall support encoding variations of payloads

#### Request Handling
- System shall support handling of various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- System shall support different content types (form data, JSON, XML, multipart)
- System shall support cookie management
- System shall support custom header insertion
- System shall implement session management

#### Response Analysis
- System shall analyze HTTP responses for evidence of successful exploitation
- System shall detect error patterns indicative of vulnerabilities
- System shall support time-based detection methods
- System shall implement differential analysis for blind vulnerability detection

## Conclusion
This requirements document outlines the necessary capabilities for SentinelVulnScan to effectively identify injection vulnerabilities in web applications. The implementation will prioritize accuracy, performance, and responsible usage while adhering to industry standards for security testing.
